# “Is Least Profitable Always Unprofitable?”

Analyzing product performance by profit across category, state, and time.

### 🧩 Project Overview

A Tableau dashboard built to challenge assumptions around product profitability. The goal was to explore if frequently flagged "low profit" items are truly unprofitable across all dimensions — or only contextually so.

---

### ❓ Problem Statement

Stakeholders assumed that least profitable items should be discontinued. However, many underperforming items vary across categories, states, and time. The dashboard empowers users to drill down and reassess these decisions.

---

### 💼 Key Business Questions

- Which categories consistently perform poorly?
- Are certain items unprofitable in only specific regions or periods?
- Is there a seasonal or regional trend in item profitability?

---

### 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Tool:** Tableau Public
- **Techniques:**
    - Filter-based exploration
    - Hierarchical drill-down (Department → Category → Item)
    - Time series line chart
    - Map visualization with profit heat scale

---

### ✨ Features

- Top 10 least profitable items
- Profit by state (map)
- Profit trend by quarter with forecast trend line
- Overall profit by category
- Interactive dropdown filters (Department, Category, Item)

### 💡 Insights & Recommendations

- Some “least profitable” items were profitable in specific states or seasons
- High-performing departments also contained long-tail low-profit products
- Recommend investigating pricing strategy and bundling options before discontinuing items
